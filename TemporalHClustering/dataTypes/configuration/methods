#This is a file that is used to define the sample methods and
#how they relate to each other. This defines a structural hierarchy
#that should be representative of the experiement conducted

#format:
#<abbrev>:<method name>:<distance value>

#the abbrev is used in the data files where the full method name would be too
#tedious to include

#the full method name is for purposes of output, and should be reflective of
#the sampling method's name as referred to by other sources

#the distance value is used to determine what sampling methods are closer
#chronologically to other sampling methods. Essentially it is this value that
#establishes the structural hierarchy of the clustering. Be sure the values
#will yield the desired ordering of groups
